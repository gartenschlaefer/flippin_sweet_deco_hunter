# the letter we sent to santa

**:butterfly: About me**
Hi, I have multiple personalities, sometimes I am Christian who likes shooting pictures of birds and nature, or Vicky who gets lost with music, Maon who collects crystals, and Ewald who loves swimming with sharks and breaking technology.
I live alone up in the icy mountains of Austria with my friends the alpine salamanders.
Sometimes when my solar panel supports enough energy, I play video games with my friends.

**:video_game: My favourite video games and genres**
I play games like: Webbed, Hades, Expedition 33, Drawful, Diablo II, Untitled Goose Game, Last of Us 2, Tetris (Gameboy Edition), Mario Kart, We Were Here.

**:guitar: My interests and hobbies**
We like to collect things, our hut is almost exploding with all the things. Of course we collect crystals, animals (especially penguins), food for me and my salamander friends, weather balloons (which fly by sometimes).
I am compatibility researcher, that is also the reason why we are in the mountains with my friends.
With the crystal we finance our research.
Always when we are currently not working we go cliff jumping and swim with our friends the sharks.

**:woman_technologist: Platform limitations and accessibility concerns**
We like to play the game on the Retro Game Pad, Web Version would also be nice, but at least PC: Windows and Apple.
I am happy with everything you create Santa, also we and our friends were very good this year.

best wishes from Christian, with love from Ewald, kind regards from Vicky, and nothing from Maon.
